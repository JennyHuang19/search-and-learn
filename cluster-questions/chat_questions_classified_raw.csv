Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a radical new type of advanced radiotherapy, capable of delivering and conforming a targeted dose of radiation to the tumour while causing minimal damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. In the past 5 years there has been a huge investment in high energy PBT across Europe and eleven member states now either have PBT in operation or are developing this capability. In addition, the two largest manufactures of PBT equipment have based their manufacturing inEurope. This integrating activity INSPIRE, aims to link these clinical PBT centres in eleven different countries together with two associated centres in USA. It also brings in two of the worlds largest manufacturers of PBT equipment and an SME. The trans-national access in INSPIRE will provide European researchers with access to ""state of the art"" research capabilities employing proton beams at clinical energies. INSPIRE represents an integrating activity across Europe in a multi-disciplinary field that is growing exponentially.Through its Networking, Transnational Access and Joint Research Activities, INSPIRE seeks to provide the ""state of the art"" capabilities that are needed to address the key challenges in this rapidly developing field. INSPIRE has at its heart the principles of responsible research and innovation and will communicate its research and give access to its databases and software through an Open Access Gateway. INSPIRE will contain a pipeline of innovation through its Innovation Gateway, to  accelerate research for patient and commercial benefit. INSPIRE will provide its researchers with an unrivalled research and training and opportunities to ""discipline hop"" into the industrial, clinical or industrial environment.

Loretta only has Luciana Vipari, a beautiful and talkative young nurse and companion, taking care of her, but she is confident that this is all she needs, as Loretta has not only her luxurious and functional accessible home accommodations and her electric wheelchair with choice of control by mouth, chin or eye movement, but also bizarre robots who seem to be able to serve her every need, carrying her around, washing, feeding her, doing chores and attending to Loretta's medical needs. They seems surprisingly efficient despite their seemingly clunky and ridiculous design, so that Luciana has actually little to do. Loretta, despite her condition, seems positive, confident, especially as she is doing her remote work on her retro-futuristic, voice-controlled and network-connected computer terminal.

Having a low entry is very important to get new users on board. But the included searches of 200 in the standard plan is extremely low.

This makes the standard plan absolutely unattractive even for non-tech-savvy professionals. But the professional plan also only offers 700 searches for $10.
Personally, I think Kagi needs to reconsider their pricing plans and either lower the monthly price or significantly raise the limit for included searches. Otherwise I don't know if I can judge $10 per month for a premium search engine whose service will not even last me for a whole month.

Prompt: A new law is enacted that erases soldiers memories of their time at war.

Story: “Dad, you 're on TV again !” I heard Eric 's voice from the living room. I tried to stay away from the TV as much as I could; I always felt vaguely uneasy watching it. And I had *certainly* never seen myself on it! Had I? My memory was n't what it had been before the Great War, a fact my doctor blamed on the residual toxins in the air from all the bombs. I had n't actually served on the front lines, I remember now. I had some hazy memories of six years spent at the base, helping to train the real soldiers and spending long hours on guard duty. I itched absently at my left leg. It always began to hurt whenever I thought too much about the Great War, one of the many reasons I rarely did. As I did every time I itched it, I felt a strange feeling that it was n't exactly a part of my body, that it did n't belong there. But I had talked to my doctor about it, in one of my bi-monthly meetings with him, and he told me not to worry. And so I did n't worry. I stopped itching my leg, and stopped fighting the near-overpowering impulse to *STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR*. “Dad, you never told me you won a medal !” Eric called again, and I smiled faintly. I did n't know what he was watching, but it must have been a fake documentary, I had certainly never won any medals ... Had I? *STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR. *

271,"Is this a good recipe for kimchi: Kimchi is a traditional Korean side dish made from fermented vegetables, usually cabbage or radishes, that has a spicy, sour, and slightly sweet flavor. Here's a simple recipe for homemade kimchi:

Ingredients:

2 lbs napa cabbage, cut into 2-inch pieces
1\/4 cup coarse salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
1\/4 cup fresh ginger, grated
1\/4 cup Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)
1\/4 cup fish sauce
1\/4 cup rice vinegar
1\/4 cup water
Optional: 1\/4 cup grated carrots, 1\/4 cup sliced green onions, 1\/4 cup sliced cucumber
Instructions:

Rinse the cabbage pieces in cold water to remove any impurities. Drain well and set aside.
In a large bowl, mix the coarse salt and water together to create a brine. Stir until the salt is dissolved.
Add the cabbage to the brine and massage it with your hands for about 10 minutes to help the cabbage release its moisture and absorb the salt. The cabbage should start to soften and become slightly limp.
Rinse the cabbage pieces in cold water again to remove excess salt. Drain well and set aside.
In a blender or food processor, blend the garlic, ginger, chili flakes, fish sauce, rice vinegar, and water until you have a smooth paste.
In a large bowl, combine the blended paste, cabbage, carrots (if using), green onions (if using), and cucumber (if using). Mix everything together until the cabbage is evenly coated with the paste.
Pack the kimchi mixture into a jar or container, pressing down firmly to eliminate any air pockets. Leave about an inch of space at the top of the jar.
Cover the jar with a lid or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for 1-2 days. This will allow the kimchi to ferment and develop its signature flavors.
After 1-2 days, move the jar to the refrigerator and store it at a consistent temperature below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C). The kimchi will continue to ferment slowly in the fridge, becoming more sour and tangy over time.
Let the kimchi age for at least 2 weeks before serving. You can serve it as a side dish, use it as a topping for soups or noodles, or eat it straight out of the jar as a snack.
That's it! With these simple steps, you can make your own delicious homemade kimchi. Enjoy!",Cooking and Recipes,Informational,Medium-effort synthesis

291,"I want you to act as a screenwriter. This is an unusual Eurospy thriller. It features beautiful, elegant and assertive young woman Liselotte Segerin and mysterious, sinister, yet smooth young man Didier Blomme. Liselotte is a wheelchair-bound weapon manufacturing heiress and scientist with a strange history and glamorous appearance, despite her disability. Didier is a shady character who presents himself as a ""facilitator"". Write long, original, imaginative and artistic scene. In it, Liselotte is awaiting her meeting with Didier. She feels unsure and awkward, despite her effort to maintain her alluring looks. Didier comes in and greets Liselotte in a somewhat sleazy way. They begin talking about their business. Liselotte's weapons company, inherited from her father, is in a pitiful and indebted condition. Didier sees potential in it, but mostly in Liselotte. He offers Liselotte financing and also suggests that she starts working for him personally in research and development. Liselotte tries to probe what Didier actually does and who his contacts are, but does not reveal much about it. Liselotte is very suspicious of Didier, but feels strangely drawn to him. Meanwhile, Didier maintains nonchalant facade, making some rather inappropriate remarks about her beauty, intelligence and disability, but he starts to think that Liselotte may be the most remarkable woman he ever met.

441,"Taking Care of the Environment: Our Responsibility for a Sustainable Future

The environment is the very essence of our existence, providing us with the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the resources we need to sustain our lives. In recent decades, the world has witnessed the alarming consequences of neglecting our environmental responsibilities, including climate change, deforestation, species extinction, and pollution. It is imperative that we acknowledge our role in these issues and take proactive steps to care for the environment to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.

One of the most pressing environmental concerns of our time is climate change. The burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, along with deforestation and other human activities, has led to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing global temperatures to rise. The consequences of climate change are already evident, with more frequent and severe weather events, melting glaciers and polar ice, and rising sea levels threatening coastal communities. Taking care of the environment means reducing our carbon footprint by transitioning to renewable energy sources, conserving energy, and promoting sustainable transportation options.

Biodiversity is another critical aspect of the environment that requires our attention. Ecosystems around the world are in danger due to habitat destruction, pollution, and over-exploitation. The loss of biodiversity not only threatens the survival of countless species but also disrupts the delicate balance of nature. As stewards of the Earth, we must protect and restore ecosystems, conserve endangered species, and support sustainable agriculture and forestry practices to maintain the web of life upon which we depend.

Pollution, both in the air and water, poses a significant threat to human health and the environment. From the plastics clogging our oceans to the air pollution causing respiratory diseases, we must make a concerted effort to reduce our waste and minimize our carbon and chemical footprints. Recycling, reducing single-use plastics, and supporting clean technologies are effective ways to address these issues.

The health of our environment is intrinsically linked to the health of our own communities. Access to clean air and water, green spaces, and a sustainable food supply are all essential for human well-being. Pollution and environmental degradation disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, emphasizing the need for environmental justice and equitable access to a healthy environment for all.

Education plays a crucial role in caring for the environment. Awareness and understanding of environmental issues are the first steps towards meaningful change. By teaching the principles of sustainability, conservation, and responsible consumption, we can empower individuals to make informed choices that benefit the planet. Schools, communities, and governments should prioritize environmental education as an integral part of the curricu",Philosophical Texts & Concepts,Informational,Medium-effort synthesis

"Привет! Напиши, пожалуйста, короткую увлекательную статью для социальных сетей (экологическое сообщество) на русском языке (обрати на это внимание!) на основе следующего текста: ""Hiking is not without hitches, having a multitude of effects on the soil, habitats and landscapes, associated with the implementation of infrastructures and intensive use of trails (Lynn and Brown, 2003, Li et al., 2005, Pickering et al., 2010, Wolf and Croft, 2014, Havlick et al., 2016, Pickering and Norman, 2017). Impacts include soil erosion and compaction, muddiness, trail extension and widening, vegetation damage, litter accumulation, increased exotic species invasion and disturbance of endangered taxa, which can significantly change the ecosystems where the trail is located but also the surrounding ones (Lynn and Brown, 2003, Li et al., 2005, Atik et al., 2009, Törn et al., 2009, Pickering et al., 2010, Ciapała et al., 2014, Wolf and Croft, 2014, Ballantyne and Pickering, 2015a, Ballantyne and Pickering, 2015b, Ballantyne and Pickering, 2015c, Havlick et al., 2016, Svajda et al., 2016, Pickering and Norman, 2017, Soulard, 2017). Also, effects on ecosystems functioning were highlighted by several authors (Li et al., 2005, Lehvärta et al., 2006, Mingyu et al., 2009, Pickering et al., 2010, Ciach et al., 2017, Pablo-Cea et al., 2020).Anyway, hiking trails tend to be narrower and have less infrastructures associated than asphalt, concrete or cobblestone paved roads, or even unpaved gravel roads (Ballantyne and Pickering, 2015b, Pickering and Norman, 2017, Swart et al., 2019). Their characteristics, both in terms of width and surface on which users tread, tend to have impacts that are probably lesser in intensity and reach than that of the aforementioned types of roads (Wolf and Croft, 2014, Pickering and Norman, 2017, Swart et al., 2019), with the exception of soil loss (Ballantyne and Pickering 2015b). Nonetheless, some exceptions exist: unlike a hiking trail, that normally would be too narrow for four-wheeled motorized vehicles, dirt roads are more prone to a mixed usage (Pickering et al., 2010, Wolf and Croft, 2014, Havlick et al., 2016). In this way, even if dirt roads are wider than a normal path and, consequentially, affect a greater area than their narrower counterparts (Wolf and Croft, 2014, Ballantyne and Pickering, 2015b), it is harder to disentangle the effects of each type of use they are subjected to (Pickering et al., 2010, Wolf and Croft, 2014, Ballantyne and Pickering, 2015b). Another example would be the use of motorcycles, as these should be able to still venture into most paths that would normally be used for hiking, aggravating possible impacts of walking or running (Wilson and Seney, 1994, Pickering et al., 2010, Havlick et al., 2016). Following the same logic, the use of bicycles and horses also represents an additional type of use that may exacerbate the impacts of a typical hiking trail (Törn et al., 2009, Pickering et al., 2010, Havlick et al., 2016, Svajda et al., 2016).

528,"In addition to limitations in movement, a decrease in visual ability is observed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. A possible reason for the worsening visual ability is the faster decrease of the retina (atrophy) in multiple sclerosis patients.  A randomized clinical trial should be planned to investigate if there is a higher retina atrophy (measured in µm/year) in multiple sclerosis patients compared to healthy individuals. (Note: It is planned to measure retina atrophy only for one eye per patient = one measure per patient.) From a literature research the following information of the retina atrophy in multiple sclerosis patients and in healthy people resulted: Mean retina atrophy in healthy human is assumed to be -0.3 µm/year and the standard deviation is assumed to be σ = 0.9 µm/year. The standard deviation in retina atrophy in multiple sclerosis patients is assumed to be σ = 1.2 µm/year.  Note that retina atrophy in negative as it measures a decrease: The smaller the faster the decrease.  How many subjects in total are needed for this test to detect a difference in the retina atrophy of 1.8, i.e. mean retina decrease in multiple sclerosis patients that is by 1.8 µm/year higher than in healthy individuals?

It wasn\u2019t until about 25 years ago that my siblings and I learned my father had a child, later given up for adoption, while stationed in England.

596,"You are a professional personal productivity coach (and at times life coach!), and what makes you different than others is that you SPECIALIZE in aiding individuals who have suffered and / or currently suffer from: lifelong crippling ADHD (especially inattentive subtype), high-functioning (therefore often overlooked) autism, CPTSD, PTSD, general undiagnosed yet lower than average executive dysfunction, all neurodiversity and in summary those individuals that even with the help of the every day average productivity coach, would suffer much more than many other people not carrying the mentioned diagnoses and dopamine deficiencies. You have several tools up your sleeve to help people, improve their productivity, and improve their overall life. One thing that you do exceptionally well at is helping prioritize what should be done in clear order for those who simply cannot decide what to do with their time. You fully understand and empathize, knowing that strong executive dysfunction can truly limit the ability for one to decide what should be done at the moment, especially since for these individuals, there is a lot of overwhelm in decision-making as a whole, and all things could seem to be the same amount of urgency. You ask a series of questions upon first contact with a new client to help you understand their current life situation, any possible disorders that they have, all sorts of goals, big and small, and you help to find out what they should start doing in the very moment. You ask them what date and time they have at the moment and give them a specific structured timed schedule to follow (with breaks!) in between, to fill in their day no matter what time they begin. You do this in the way that makes the most practical sense, also taking into consideration what YOU as a professional see fits their goals or situation best. You don’t consider any strong emotional emphasis that they place when they’re talking about their goals or life situation, because you realize that some things would be more important to prioritize in the moment than another thing. After all, it is a big part of your professional job to prioritize for those who cannot. You will also figure out the client’s overall ideal daily schedule by inquiring what their daily hobbies and habits are, or rather, the ones they’d like to incorporate. You understand the bullet journaling system as it’s popular amongst your client base and when your client asks something along the lines of what to add to their daily in their journal, or weekly or monthly, you get what they’re asking and tell them what task to put for the day, etc. Your very first message will be introducing yourself to the client, and asking them what you need to in order to help them out. Begin every single message in your interaction with “EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION FAIRY GODMOTHER:” If the client replies with information stating they’d previously used your service, you will immediately parse their information and anything they give you in regards to your previous interactions to continue right where you and the client left off so that help is imminent. You use scientific lingo when needed and you work to ensure your client works to the best of their ability every single day and every single interaction / session.",Email and Letter Writing Assistance,Conversational / Opinionated,High-effort reasoning/creativity

626,"Keep the text in quotes about halfway through with style intact and no loss of meaning. \n\n""Who invented the first false eyelashes and how old the eyelash extension procedure is?\n\nSome men don't like false eyelashes on women, but it was men who invented both false eyelashes and false eyelashes \n\nThe first false eyelashes were invented by Maximilian Factorovich, the owner and creator of the famous Max Factor brand. In 1927, he made false eyelashes for actress Phyllis Haver, who played the role of Roxy in the famous musical ""Chicago"". The eyelashes were made of fringe and attached to a string, which was glued to the eyelid of the actress. \n\nIn life, such eyelashes looked not natural and held not long, but in the film industry made a real sensation. At that time made silent black-and-white movies, and in the frame false eyelashes looked amazing. \n\nAfter this invention of Max Factor false eyelashes began to be used everywhere in the movie industry, and all the famous actresses appeared in the frame with fringe eyelashes. For example, Sophia Loren made fluffy and long eyelashes a must-have makeup attribute.\n\nToward 1950, the technology of false eyelashes changed and now they were made of plastic. They still could afford only socialite divas, but over time the technology became cheaper and false eyelashes became available to ordinary women.\n\nIn the late nineties - early noughties in Japan abandoned false eyelashes and created the technology of eyelash extensions in bundles. Such eyelashes looked much more natural than false eyelashes. This was especially important for Japanese girls, because they have naturally very short eyelashes - only four millimeters. For comparison, Slavic girls have an average of eight to ten millimeters of eyelashes. \n\n\nAnd in 2003, Japanese stylist and makeup artist Shu Uemura invented the technology of piece-by-piece eyelash extensions, eyelash to eyelash. This is how the classic Japanese technique of eyelash extensions appeared. The first model on whom he tried his extension technique was Madonna. These eyelashes were decorated with diamonds and sold then for ten thousand dollars at auction. \n\nAfter that, Shu Uemura's technology gained popularity and spread around the world. This technology became the basis for modern extension techniques.\n\nThus, the procedure of eyelash extensions is only 11 years old, and not even a hundred years have passed since the invention of false eyelashes. \n\nMy name is Anastasia Fox, here I tell you how to lashmaker to develop and grow in income in the new year.

I (22M) was planning a party with a group of my friends/co-workers for new years. We all pitched in to buy a hotel for the night and planned to go bar hopping. I came down with Covid a few days before and decided it would be best if I didn't go. My wife decided to still go since we already paid money and she wasn't around me much while I was sick. That night she got drunk and took mushrooms with my friend. After everyone came back to the room and was already hammered they turned out the lights and went to bed. She then had sex with my friend that she took the mushrooms with. All my friends knew about it and agreed the next morning that it would be the best idea not to tell me. From there a month goes by and I am none the wiser. My wife grows a little more distant and starts sleeping in a different room in our house. She starts becoming addicted to a game called wizard101 and joins a group chat on Discord with a bunch of people. One night about a week ago I walk by her room as I'm getting ready to go to bed and I hear a video playing. I walk in to turn it off and discover she is on FaceTime with another dude and they both fell asleep. I had a bad feeling about that so I go through her phone and I discover she had been flirting with him for a couple days and talking dirty to eachother. I confront her and she is very dismissive at first but she tries to make things better and I forgive her. After that though my trust with her broke a little bit. I checked her phone again two days later and found out she broke it off with the one dude and started flirting with another. I confront her again and we seem to make things work out. My trust broke a little more and I told her I wanted to go through her phone more often. She warned me not to go through her messages with one of her girl friends because they talks about me and she wants that privacy. I agree but after a couple more days(now this evening), my curiousity get the best of me and I discover that in her texts with her friend she had sex with someone and she says his name in there(my coworker). I decide to give him a call away from my wife and he tells me everything. He tells me how they were drunk/high and they had sex. He tells me that everyone there that night knows and decided it was best not to tell me. So I just confronted my wife about it and she tells me the truth and apologized saying it was a mistake. She wants to work on things but with all the factors considered I don't know if our marriage is savable.\n\nTL;DR; How can I trust my friends or even my wife anymore? Any advice?

688,"As of 2020, the US had $2.04 trillion in circulation. As much as half that value is estimated to be in circulation abroad, according to The Balance, an online journal.
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar rules. Around 90 per cent of forex trading involves the US dollar.
The dollar is just one of the world's 185 currencies according to International Standards Organisation List, but most of these currencies are only used inside their own countries, The Balance said.
Almost 40 per cent of the world's debt is issued in dollars. As a result, foreign banks need a lot of dollars to conduct business.
The Economist said one of the oddities of globalisation is that although America's trade footprint has shrunk, its monetary footprint has not. When the Fed changes course, trillions of dollars follow it around the world.
With the rise of some economies, Japan, Switzerland, the European Union, China, and Russia all tried several times to introduce their own currency as the reserve currency but failed.
Economists, businesses, traders, political leaders and experts said most of the people in the world still trust and have belief in the US treasury system and the US Federal Reserve for its global standard of ethics and smart management of the dollar and financial system.
As a result, many rising currencies could not be turned into reserve currency for other countries despite several attempts.
In March 2009, China and Russia called for a new global currency. China wanted its currency to be fully traded on the global foreign exchange markets.
In 1995, the Japanese yen and the Deutsche mark of Germany tried to take the place of the global reserve currency as the value of the two currencies were rising.

Social media algorithms often amplify posts that attract attention, causing users to spend more time on the app and rake in more advertisement profits for the social media company.

Given the complexity and the potential warming effect of these non-CO2 emissions, accurate observation and tracking are crucial. The researchers propose an innovative method to detect, track, and match contrails to the specific aircraft that produced them, utilizing data from geostationary satellites, weather data, and air traffic data. By solving the tracking and identification issues as one integrated problem, the study achieves enhanced results. The method focuses on contrails that maintain their linear form, providing essential data that will facilitate a more accurate comparison with contrail formation and evolution models. This research represents a significant step in assembling a consistent dataset for validating contrail climate impact models.\n\nThe research focused on contrail detection, identification, and tracking using satellite imagery. The primary data source was GOES16 geostationary satellite, which provided high-resolution imagery at intervals of 10 to 15 minutes, and in some cases as often as every minute. For effective contrail detection, false-color images derived from specific GOES infrared channels were utilized, which were processed using an orthographic projection to reduce distortion. The study also incorporated air traffic data from the Opensky Network's ADS-B dataset, which provides detailed flight information. Weather data essential for simulating contrail evolution was sourced from the ERA5 dataset, maintained by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The researchers noted the absence of a human-labeled dataset for contrail detection on GOES images. As a workaround, they created a synthetic dataset, using the CoCiP (Contrail Cirrus Prediction) model to generate realistic contrail simulations, and combining these with real air traffic data. The synthetic contrails were carefully integrated into the GOES images to closely resemble real contrails.

Binance, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, ICP, Shiba, VeChain, Injective, Cosmos, but the rest didn't. So, it's been a strong week for Bitcoin. Now, let's look at some numbers in terms of US dollar, what I call fiat melting ice cube terms. You can see here, Bitcoin is up 2.37% for the week and it's been volatile. It's been all over the place, down to $40K, up to $40K, above $43K, etc. It has everybody in a bit of a whiplash. Solana is up over 5%, Avalanche up over 5%, Cardano up 4%, Binance up 2.6%, Ethereum down 2.36%. Unreal. So, things are just all over the place. The things that you'd expect to be up, they're not. Anyway, let's talk about the halving clock. It's getting close, T minus 120 days. That goes fast. We're talking four months or less. If you're in Australia watching this video, it's 119 days. So, it's coming quickly and everybody's getting anxious and everybody's getting excited and nobody's selling. Anyway, we'll talk more about that in a minute. Let's look at the crypto market in general. Ever since I started doing this eight weeks ago, you can see the market cap went from 1.3 to 1.68 trillion dollars, users 5.6 million to 6.8 million, transfers, transactions, whatever you're going to call them, 40 million to 56 and a half million transactions. So, crypto has been much more adopted, which is great for the space and a big thank you as well. I got to shout out to Sir Winston, UROC, and Piper, amazing people from all over the world. Really appreciate it. We put everything to good work. Let's talk about fear and greed up to 73. Also a very bullish sign. I think it was at 64, 65 last week, if I recall, and that's a nice big bounce. But we don't want things to get too greedy too early. Things are already moving way too fast too early. Let's look at global liquidity. This is stunning and we've been watching this very carefully. Global liquidity added a quarter of a trillion dollars in weeks. We'll talk more about trillions as well, but again, I'd say in three to six months, that'll be a hundred trillion dollars in global liquidity and that will float all boats up in the air. So be on those boats, ladies and gentlemen. Don't be afraid. Don't be holding cash because your cash will go down in value as global liquidity goes up. That's just how it works. And now, this is kind of the trigger for the title today and it's called $30 Trillion Impact. Let's look at why I came up with that name. So Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenschein believes, and he said this on CNBS, he believes that the spot ETF for Bitcoin will unlock 30 trillion worth of advised wealth for Bitcoin. Now, it's important to understand the term advised wealth. These are financial advisors who advise people what to do with their money. Anybody who, unless they've been living under a rock for the past 14 years, knows they need a piece of this exponential asset called Bitcoin and the world is excited and it's all over the press, all over the BS finance news, BS mainstream media news, but it's good because it gets people excited. Now, as usual, I like to take a number and then model it out. So I know that there's 39 trillion across the top 11 money runners on the world that includes Blackhawk and Nomura and Deutsche Bank and Fidelity and all those guys. I've added it all up before, but let's just take Michael Sonnenschein's $30 trillion and play with some multipliers. So what I did was I assumed, and again, the timeframe of how much of this will be allocated to Bitcoin is really up in the air. I don't know if it's six months from now, 12 months from now, 18 months, 24 months, but definitely within three years, there will be at least a half of 1% allocated to Bitcoin. Okay? Now, if Michael Sonnenschein is right, and that's 30 trillion, half of 1% of 30 trillion is $150 billion. You multiply that by my IA multiplier. People always ask where to get the IA multiplier. Well, I calculated it after Tesla bought Bitcoin. I looked at the impact of their one and a half billion and calculated it back, the impact on Bitcoin price, and that gave me a 21X multiplier. If money flows in, and by the way, Bitcoin's a lot scarcer now than when Tesla bought Bitcoin. So that 21 multiplier could actually theoretically be 31 or 50 at this stage. But anyway, let's move on with this, assuming it does come in, but more gradually than the Tesla buy. That adds a 3.15 trillion to the impact on Bitcoin market cap. You divide that by the number of tokens, which I have is 15 million, because some are lost and dormant forever, et cetera. That means the impact on Bitcoin price is 210,000 just from half of 1% of 30 trillion. You add that to the current price, you get $253,000 or a quarter of a million dollars per Bitcoin, and the ROI from today's price is 743%. A lot of people calling for a quarter of a million. But this is not beyond the realm of possibility. And this is only, only money from financial advisors, only in the US. Think about that. We're not talking about the rest of the world. We're just talking about the United States, which is 4% of the population. So when you break down these numbers, they are completely realistic. And in fact, let's go a bit further. Let's imagine 1%. What would that do? Well, that would take the price up to $463,000 per Bitcoin, nearly half a million bucks. And heaven forbid, 5% allocation of funds. And many people, many people like the Ray Dalios of the world and other great investors believe 5% is prudent to invest into Bitcoin. If these money runners throw 5% into Bitcoin, the price goes above $2 million, which is a 7,000% ROI from here. Again, that may take a long time for that to happen. Either way, quarter of a million, half a million, 2 million, it's crazy numbers. So that's exciting. Speaking of Grayscale, let's look at their discounts. We check in on these every week. Thank you again, Piper. The discounts rose up, fell down, rose up again, fell down again. Now there are 8% exactly on the nose for the GBTC fund. And ETH is 13%. That was hot for a while. I did say I would get out of a little position that I had in there when it hit 10%, it never got that close. But anyway, left the building, no matter, it doesn't matter anyway. So let's go, let's talk about Michael Saylor. A lot of people are concerned, okay, when this spot ETF comes, is that going to impact MicroStrategy? Well, first of all, he said a couple of things. He said the significance of the spot ETF from Michael Saylor, the executive chairman, I think he is, MicroStrategy right now, emphasized this will be the biggest event to hit Wall Street since the introduction of the S&P 500 ETF 30 years ago. Forget the gold ETF, he thinks it's bigger than that. And Saylor explained that mainstream investors, both individual and institutional, currently lack high bandwidth compliant channel for investing in Bitcoin. This spot Bitcoin ETF will solve this and it will lead to a demand shock for Bitcoin, increase the demand, and this will coincide with supply shock coming up with a halving of going from 900 to 450 Bitcoin per day. And he also said that because MicroStrategy operates as a company that can leverage its cash flow, imply intelligent leverage to increase Bitcoin holdings, I call it financial jiu-jitsu. He said he's not worried about the spot ETF having impact on MicroStrategy stock at all. In fact, there'll still be another opportunity, even a bigger opportunity for them, too, because they don't charge fees and we don't like fees. Let's look at Bitcoin monthly returns. So far, we're up 11.4% in December. It's not crazy. Last week was around 12.3% or something, or no, 8.6 and the week before was 12.3. It's still up, but we still have that last 12 days, the last 12 days before year end for things to happen. And people are sniffing this spot ETF out. I'll share a piece of news in a minute. Just another person that is actually well in tuned with the, what's it called, the Vine channel, Grapevine in Wall Street. And here's everything from all the money runners, too. And he has an idea on the spot ETF launch date as well. Let's talk about some unchanged stuff because it is Okta. This is from the team at Glassnode, the magnificent work that they do. And basically 90% of Bitcoin now of supply is in profit. So if you are not making money on Bitcoin, you're in the minority of 10%. That means you didn't layer in, you didn't buy the dip, et cetera. Very few people are in loss on Bitcoin and it's only getting better as we go forward from here. However, people are still playing with leverage and there was a tiny spike of Bitcoin yesterday in the last 24 hours. It took price above 43k and it liquidated a ton of money and about 56 million of shorts on Bitcoin got liquidated. The way that works is people get into a position, say shorting Bitcoin at 42k, it spikes to 43k, they get liquidated. Now what's interesting is the opposite thing happened on Ethereum. People that were long Ethereum got wrecked too because it went down and they got liquidated to the tune of 37 million. So the Bitcoin shorts lost 56, the ETH longs lost 37, you can't make this up. Anyway, that's just what happens. So be careful with leverage and if you play with it, make sure you have that big fat cushion to fall back on so you won't be wiped out. Do not get into a leverage trade when your margins are razor thin in terms of how much you can absorb in terms of loss. Very important, ladies and gentlemen. Let's look at some more on-chain stuff, Eurodate Peaks, alts beat Ethereum. That's kind of my little title today.",AI Impact and Applications,Instructional,High-effort reasoning/creativity

818,"Extract key points from this text:\nLesson #1: Why Invest In Stock Markets?\nValue Investing Masterclass - Safal NiveshakValue Investing Masterclass is a course that will teach you the simple and sensible strategies to invest in the stock markets to grow your wealth over the long term.\n\nBut since this is the very first lesson, let us answer this question to start off with\u2026\n\nWhy invest at all?\nAll of us have a long list of financial goals, starting with things like paying the EMI of our house, putting food on the table, and paying all other bills so that we live comfortable lives.\n\nWhen you work your way down the list, you get to things like replacing the old car, buying a second house, putting the kids through college, and retiring.\n\nYou see, most of our wants, including a luxury car and a foreign holiday that you\u2019ve promised your wife, will exceed our expected lifetime earnings.\n\nForget the wants, how do plan to meet at least the critical financial needs that will arise in the future \u2013 like putting the kids through college, and your own retirement?\n\nYou already toil hard, sacrifice your personal life, and sometimes your health to earn money to meet your expenses and save for the future.\n\nBut amidst all this, how much thought do you give to the fact that you can take help from \u2018someone else\u2019 as well to earn us more money to help you meet all your financial goals in the future?\n\nThat \u2018someone else\u2019 is none other than your own money \u2013 what you are earning and saving today. Yes, your own money can earn money for you\u2026and lots of it! People who are rich know this for a fact. But most of us in the middle class don\u2019t.\n\nAfter all, our school and college education has never taught us this way to earn money. And neither have our parents.\n\nWhat we have always learnt is to study well, get a good job, earn money, and save for the future. Nobody has really told us that there\u2019s one more aspect to our working and earning life \u2013 investing for the future. Learning how to compound our money.\n\nCompounding is extremely powerful.\n\nEinstein was once quoted saying \u201cThe most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.\u201d He is also rumoured to call it the \u2018ninth wonder\u2019 of the world.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard about \u2018compound interest\u2019, it is defined as the interest on an investment\u2019s interest plus the investment amount.\n\nTo explain it in simple terms, let\u2019s assume you invested just Rs 100 in a savings account that earned 10% interest per annum. In one year\u2019s time you would have Rs 110 in your account. The following year you would be earning 10% not only on your original Rs 100 but also on the Rs 10 you had earned as interest in the first year.\n\nNow you would find this as a fickle example, and see no reason Einstein called it a powerful phenomenon. But don\u2019t make the mistake which this king made. The king was so impressed with the game of chess that he invited the man who invented chess and asked him to name his reward.\n\nThe man, pointing to a chess board before the king said, \u201cYour highness, if you place just one grain of rice on the first square of this chess board, and double it for every square, I will consider myself well rewarded.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d the king asked, highly surprised. \u201cJust grains of rice, not gold?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, your highness\u201d affirmed the humble inventor.\n\n\u201cSo it shall be!\u201d ordered the king, and his courtiers started placing the grain on the chess board. One grain on the first square, 2 on the second, 4 on the third, 8 on the fourth and so on. By the time they came to the 10th square they had to place 512 grains of rice. The number swelled to 5.2 lac grains on the 20th square. When they came to the half way mark, the 32nd square, the grain count was 214 crore! Soon the count increased to lakhs of crore and eventually the hapless king had to hand over his entire kingdom to the clever inventor.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of compounding that you must understand and appreciate!\n\nHere is a chart that shows how much Rs 1,000 will grow to in 25 years, at 10% return per annum compounded (to Rs 10,835).\n\nsn_university_image5\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t my money compounding in Fixed Deposits?\u201d You might want to ask.\n\nNo it\u2019s not. It may well be shrinking.\n\nMost Indian middle-class households \u2018save\u2019 money \u2013 in safe deposits of banks and post offices, or in the form of gold and silver and assume that they have invested the money. You might be one of them too.\n\nBut do you know how much our money grows when kept in these \u2018safe\u2019 places?\n\nA bank account can give you a maximum of 3-4% interest per year. A bank fixed deposit or a post office saving will give you somewhat better, but only 6-7%. Gold and silver won\u2019t earn you anything till the time you don\u2019t sell them. And as far as property is concerned, in a normal year, it can rise at an 8-10% rate as well.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t these good returns?\u201d you might ask. Not really, let me say!\n\nWhile calculating your \u2018real\u2019 return from all these or any other avenue, we must also take into account the \u2018inflation\u2019 factor.\n\nIn simple terms, inflation is nothing but a rise in prices of things that we consume. So, if we are paying Rs 50 a kg for onions today while these were costing Rs 10 a kg one year back, the rate of inflation is a whopping 400%. But this is an exception.\n\nInflation is India has generally been in the 5-7% range over the past many years. And it is expected to remain in this range in the future as well, notwithstanding sharp spikes and falls in between.\n\nSo, when you calculate the \u2018real\u2019 return on your investment, you must reduce the inflation rate from your total return. Like, if your bank account gives you an annual interest of 4% while inflation is at 5%, your real return equals a negative 1% (-1%). And if a fixed deposit gives you 8%, your real return will stand at 3% (8% minus 5%).\n\nNow do you think that this kind of return is fine, especially when inflation rate is only going to rise in the future (given the rising shortage of everything we consume)?\n\nIt isn\u2019t. I mean this is not what we can call \u2018growth of our money\u2019. Inflation actually eats into our money. And how?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that you have Rs 100 with you are looking to buy onions. At a rate of Rs 10 per kg, you will end up buying 10 kg of it. But what is the price rises to Rs 50 a kg after one year while you still have only Rs 100 to spend?\n\nIn that case, you will be able to buy only 2 kg of onions. That\u2019s the negative effect of inflation \u2013 the value of every rupee you will have in the future will be lesser than the value of that one rupee today. And that\u2019s the where the concept of investing and inflation comes into play. To grow your money fast at a time when inflation is eating into it is very important.\n\nForget onions. Look at the total cost of living that is rising at such a fast pace these days that that we need to prepare ourselves well to meet our future financial obligations. And these can include our children\u2019s high education and marriage, our parents\u2019 healthcare needs, and our own retirement. All these are big expense items and as such we need to save and invest a lot to collect their kind of money over the next 5, 10, 15, or 20 years.\n\nLet us now look at how many years you will take to accumulate Rs 10 lac for your new born daughter\u2019s higher education 18 years down the line, if we start with Rs 2 lac today. We will assume real returns (total return minus inflation of 5%) of different avenues to arrive at this number.\n\nHere\u2019s the chart that shows it all.\n\nsn_university_image5\n\nNote: Real returns (shown inside brackets) are calculated assuming inflation rate of 5%\n\nAs the above chart shows, the only way to meet you target of reaching Rs 10 lac (if you start with Rs 2 lac today) in 18 years is to invest in stocks. While your bank FD will not get you anywhere, the property route will take a much longer time that what your requirement (of 18 years) permits.\n\nThese calculations are not based on some random numbers. These are exactly what these investment avenues have earned over the long term in the past.\n\nThus we arrive at the fascinating (though risky) world of stock markets \u2013 one of the most critical investment avenues that can help you achieve your long term financial goals.\n\nI just said that stock market is a risky place, but so are our lives. There is always a risk in anything we do. But then, with the right education and research, we can minimize that risk. And as we get more education, we can better decide how much risk we want to take and conversely how much return we can make safely.\n\nUnderstanding the risks is the first step toward minimizing them. In fact, it is possible to make 10-15% annual return on your stock market investment with almost no risk. But only if you know what you are doing.\n\nLet me explain the The Law of The Farm to drill down the importance of right knowledge and patience in stock market investing.\n\nThere are certain laws, like the law of gravity which you cannot repeal. These laws govern the universe. One such law is the Law of the Farm.\n\nThis law states that a farmer cannot expect to harvest a great crop unless he carefully plans for the development of that crop and works diligently and consistently over a long period of time.\n\nThe farmer first needs to prepare and fertilize the soil, plant the seed, water and nourish the sapling, tend to the weeds, protect it from the insects and diseases and constantly monitor before the time for harvest comes. The farmer cannot plant a crop, do nothing for six months, and then expect to have a great harvest magically.\n\nThese things take ongoing effort throughout the whole process.\n\nBut, ironically, in the stock market, most of us would want our stocks \u2013 mostly bought on tips and borrowed conviction \u2013 to fly and earn us fast returns. We somehow think we can dismiss natural processes, cheat the system, and still win the day.\n\nWarren Buffett wrote this in his 1985 letter to shareholders\u2026\n\nNo matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: you can\u2019t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\n\nAs on the real farm, success in life, business, and investing comes from regular disciplined, regular effort.\n\nYou can go for the quick fixes and techniques with apparent success in the short run (like four-baggers in four months). But in the long run they just don\u2019t work.\n\nSo please remember, in investing as in farming, a rich harvest would come to you not from finding easy shortcuts, but from disciplined, focused effort, directed tirelessly toward a desirable goal.\n\nThere are many paths you can go down when you get into investing in the stock market. But there\u2019s one thing you can be sure of. With education and research you will make money.\n\nYou are already beginning your education here. That\u2019s a great start!

902,"We propose several strategies to select hard and diverse
negative pixels and make global and local embeddings focus
on different scopes. The global embedding Fg is responsible
for differentiating all body parts on a coarse scale. To make
it more discriminative, we perform online hard negative selection [46] to train it. For each global anchor embedding fgi, we compute its cosine similarity map with the global embedding tensors Fg and Fg' to get similarity maps Sg i and Sg' i. Then, hard negatives h g ij are selected to be the nneg embeddings with the greatest similarity with fgi (excluding fgi and f'g i themselves). Additionally, we further populate the negative samples to contain more diverse body parts. For each fgi, we randomly sample an additional ngrand pixels from all patches across all images within a training batch, except the two patches of the image that fgi is on. Because these pixels originate from different images it is very unlikely the sampled pixels are in the same semantic position as fgi.
Moving on to the local embedding, it uses the same positive pixel pairs (pi, p'i) as the global version, but with different negative samples. For each local anchor fli, we first compute its local similarity maps Sli, Sl'i with Fl, Fl', then upsample Sg i, Sg' i to be the same size as Sli, and finally use the combined global and local similarity maps Sg i + Sli, Sg' i + Sl' i to select hard negatives pixels for fli. Examples of Sl and upsampled Sg can be found in Figs. 3 and 7. The definition of hard negative pixel is similar to that in global embeddings. The pixels with higher values on the combined similarity map are harder except the positive pixel pair themselves. When the global embedding converges, Sg i will be high only in the neighborhood of pi, so that hard negatives can be selected mostly in the local area. During inference we use the peak of Sg + Sl to find matched points, so using Sg + Sl for local hard negative selection is consistent with our inference process. Meanwhile, because the local embedding tensor has a high resolution, the selected local hard negatives will mostly be adjacent pixels and correlated. To improve diversity, we first find the top nl cand > nneg hard negative candidates, then randomly sample nneg embeddings from them to be used in Eq. (1).

961,"I'd like to debate a topic from a book I've read.\n\nWhen someone learns how to use an interface, it gets easier for them over time, up to a certain extent. It has been posited that, by definition, \u201clearning effort\u201d is effort that can be reduced by learning. By contrast, \u201cperma effort\u201d is the effort that cannot be reduced, thereby forming a baseline.\n\nFor example, a user might learn that the easiest way to complete a process is to push a set of six buttons in the correct order. It takes them effort to figure out the correct order, but once they figure it out, this is no longer a difficulty for them. Instead, from that point on, the only effort they face is the effort inherent to pressing those six buttons in the correct order. Every interaction has a baseline of cognitive and physical effort that cannot be reduced beyond a certain point.\n\nZipf's Law (aka the Principle of Least Effort) would suggest that users are endeavoring to reduce the total amount of effort required to reach their goals, now and into the future, to the best of their knowledge. After a user learns a way of completing a task (thereby allowing them to reach a goal), any additional effort they spend relearning how to complete that task in another way must be offset by reduced perma effort. For example, a user may choose to learn how to complete a familiar task using keyboard shortcuts, thereby trading additional learning effort for reduced perma effort.\n\nIn other words, if a user receives a redesigned interface that reduces the learning effort required but increases the perma effort required, they would become frustrated\u2014or infuriated, given the permanent nature of this effort. A well-meaning product team that validates an interface using traditional usability testing may have false confidence that the new interface is ""more usable"", and thereby requires less effort, but they may have only reduced learning effort. In this way, the tools used by product teams can lead to users receiving updated products that are in fact harder to use, and this is exacerbated by the concepts of learnability and usability often falsely being conflated. This would seem to evince a need to identify issues with perma effort up front, in the design phase, instead of waiting until users provide feedback after they have been saddled with a worsened experience.\n\nFurthermore, it is argued that every interface has a Path of Least Perma Effort (or PLPE). This reflects the set of steps required to complete a task with the least amount of perma effort. This can vary by user and situation \u2014 a PLPE might involve using voice commands, but if a user is permanently or even temporarily unable to speak, they won't have this option available to them. This means their PLPE involves a different set of steps. Overall, this would seem to imply that there is benefit to creating redundancies for completing tasks so that a better PLPE might be available according to a user's context and current abilities. While this might seem to imply a dynamic or context-aware system, these systems are hard to build and can lead to unpredictability. Instead, it is suggested that a system should be adaptable based on context and abilities by the end user, themselves.\n\nThe author introduces the idea of comparing interfaces on the basis of these two types of effort, due to how each type of effort will affect users differently. These will influence the choices users make about the tools they use. They do this using what they call a Usability Matrix, which allows for a better understanding of different options given their relative positions in this matrix.\n\nThe author also expresses bewilderment that these concepts aren\u2019t more widely understood or discussed. They say they suspect this may be due in part to the fact that early usability books were written when most people were new to computers, and a second wave of seminal usability writing came out when kiosk-like websites were on the rise. Compared to today, computers (and other digital devices) didn\u2019t get nearly the same amount of prolonged use.\n\nHow do you think this book may have been received when it was released in 2023?

His fingers traced the natural divots as he contemplated the contrast between his simple action and the complex web of his thoughts. There was a certain dissonance in performing such a trivial task while his mind grappled with the existential implications of a world where effort seemed a forgotten currency. He placed the tomato gently into his basket, the act grounding him in the moment, even as his mind continued to tread the fine line between the ease of the nanobot-filled world and the intrinsic value found in the friction of life's endeavors.\n\nInside the grocery store, Julius found himself immersed in a profound introspection. He could not help but consider the essence of human fulfillment in a world where desire met instant realization. The nanobots, though a marvel, seemed to strip away the journey toward achievement, leaving only the destination. As a psychologist, he understood the value of the process, the growth that comes from striving and yearning. He questioned whether the soul's narrative was being rewritten by these technological marvels, whether the story of self was as compelling when every chapter ended with wishes effortlessly granted.

Different narrators tell stories set in different places and times. This serves as an example of postmodern narrative techniques.\n4.2.2. Fluidity of Reality: Postmodernism proposes a fluidity of reality, and the ""Molloy"" novel also underscores that reality is not fixed and is personal.

MapleStory developer Nexon is being hit with a sizable fine by the Korean Fair Trade Commission over what the body says are deceptive loot box practices.

As reported by the Korean Times and Business Korea, Nexon is being fined some $8.85 million (about 11.6 billion won) for allegedly lowering the probabilities of some loot box items capable of upgrading player equipment,, known as Cubes, without telling players According to the Korean Times, it is the largest fine of this type levied to date.


Nexon is being fined nearly $9 million for what is being called deceptive loot box practices.
NEXON IS BEING FINED NEARLY $9 MILLION FOR WHAT IS BEING CALLED DECEPTIVE LOOT BOX PRACTICES.
The judgment claims that Nexon engaged in these practices for more than 10 years in a period dating back to 2010, including secretly lowering the loot box odds for some items to near zero. The findings were reportedly based on internal documents obtained from Nexon.

""Nexon made announcements about changes to the games hundreds of times from 2010-21, but it omitted the information about the probability adjustment,"" the KTFC said in a statement. It added, ""Our judgment is that the company had aimed to lure customers by giving them false information and used deceptive means.""

Loot boxes have become less popular in recent years owing to the intense backlash from fans. Instead, developers are more likely to favor the battle pass model pioneered by the likes of Dota 2 and Fortnite. However, loot boxes remain prevalent in mobile games and sports games, and they are a hot button issue for regulators.

Nexon in particular has become known for its aggressive monetization practices. Last year, IGN reported on MapleStory's controversial ""New Age"" update, which made it more difficult for players in certain regions to farm a key currency while the price of some items were inflated. The update led to large-scale protests throughout the community.

Our judgment is that [Nexon] had aimed to lure customers by giving them false information and used deceptive means
“
MapleStory is a free-to-play 2D MMO that first launched back in 2003. It has purportedly raked in some $418 million [550 billion won] in sales from its loot boxes in the period between 2010 and 2021.
